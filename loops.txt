For:
The For Loop comes first because of its simplicity and ease of use. It is a very user-friendly kind of loop that runs with a method of using a counter. The value is first set with an appropriate condition, which is also called ‘initializing a loop’. Next, the terminal or final value is specified. The For Loop makes things really easy when you need to run a set of codes multiple times.

For.......In:
Another way of looping is the For In Loop. Unlike the For Loop, this loop won’t be using a counter. So this makes the whole process even more simple and hassle-free. In fact, the For In Loop is essentially a simplified version of the For Loop.

For.......Of:
The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects, including: built-in String, Array, array-like objects (e.g., arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables. It invokes a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property of the object.

For.......Each:
forEach() calls a provided callbackFn function once for each element in an array in ascending index order. It is not invoked for index properties that have been deleted or are uninitialized.
